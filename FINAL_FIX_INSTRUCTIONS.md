# FINAL FIX - Mock Exam Not Starting

## Issue
`Uncaught ReferenceError: startMockExam is not defined`

## Root Cause
**Browser Cache** - Your browser is loading an old version of the JavaScript files that doesn't have the function properly exported.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Cache-Busting Parameters
Updated `student-dashboard.html` to force browser to reload all scripts:
```html
<script src="enhanced-mock-exam.js?v=2"></script>
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Added console logs to `enhanced-mock-exam.js` to confirm loading:
- "Loading enhanced-mock-exam.js..."
- "Enhanced mock exam functions exported to window"
- "Enhanced-mock-exam.js loaded successfully!"

### 3. Fixed Function Conflicts
Renamed conflicting functions in old files to prevent overwrites.

## HOW TO FIX NOW

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
**IMPORTANT: You MUST do this!**

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"

OR

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Hard refresh)

**Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cache"
3. Click "Clear Now"

### Step 2: Close and Reopen Browser
1. Close ALL browser windows
2. Reopen browser
3. Navigate to `student-dashboard.html`

### Step 3: Check Console
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. You should see:
   ```
   Loading enhanced-mock-exam.js...
   Enhanced mock exam initialized
   Enhanced mock exam functions exported to window
   window.startMockExam: function
   Enhanced-mock-exam.js loaded successfully!
   ```

### Step 4: Test Function
In console, type:
```javascript
startMockExam()
```

Should start the exam!

## Alternative: Test Files

### Test 1: Simple Test
Open `test-simple.html` in browser
- This loads ONLY the enhanced-mock-exam.js
- Click the button to test
- Should show if function exists

### Test 2: Full Test
Open `test-mock-exam.html` in browser
- Has all required HTML elements
- Tests the complete flow
- Click buttons to verify

## If STILL Not Working

### Check 1: Verify File Loaded
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
4. Look for `enhanced-mock-exam.js?v=2`
5. Should show Status: 200 (OK)
6. Click on it and check "Response" tab
7. Should see the JavaScript code

### Check 2: Check for Errors
1. Open Console (F12)
2. Look for RED error messages
3. Common errors:
   - "Failed to load resource" → File path wrong
   - "Unexpected token" → Syntax error in JS
   - "Cannot read property" → Missing HTML element

### Check 3: Manual Load Test
1. Open `test-simple.html`
2. This has minimal dependencies
3. If this works, problem is in student-dashboard.html
4. If this doesn't work, problem is in enhanced-mock-exam.js

### Check 4: Incognito Mode
1. Open browser in Incognito/Private mode
2. Navigate to student-dashboard.html
3. This bypasses all cache
4. If it works here, it's definitely a cache issue

## Quick Fix Commands

### Force Reload Everything
In browser console:
```javascript
location.reload(true);
```

### Check if Function Exists
```javascript
console.log(typeof window.startMockExam);
// Should output: "function"
```

### Manually Define Function (Temporary)
If desperate, paste this in console:
```javascript
window.startMockExam = function() {
    document.getElementById('dashboard-section').style.display = 'none';
    document.getElementById('mock-exam-interface').style.display = 'block';
    alert('Mock exam started (manual override)');
};
```

## Files to Use for Testing

1. **test-simple.html** - Minimal test, just the function
2. **test-mock-exam.html** - Full test with all elements
3. **student-dashboard.html** - The actual dashboard

## What Should Happen

When you click "Start Mock Exam":
1. ✅ Console logs appear
2. ✅ Dashboard div hides
3. ✅ Mock exam interface div shows
4. ✅ Question loads
5. ✅ Timer starts
6. ✅ Voice message plays

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Not clearing cache** - This is #1 issue!
❌ **Testing in same browser tab** - Close and reopen
❌ **Not checking console** - Always check for errors
❌ **Wrong file path** - Make sure you're opening the right HTML file

## Success Checklist

- [ ] Hard refreshed page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Closed and reopened browser
- [ ] Opened student-dashboard.html
- [ ] Pressed F12 and checked console
